## QuizMaster 


Welcome to QuizMaster, a full-stack quiz game developed during the School of Applied Technology (SALT) Hack Day Challenge. In just one day, I created a fun and educational quiz game to enhance my knowledge of React, TypeScript, databases, and Java.

### Technical specification:

- Database container: Docker  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Backend: Java Spring (Dependencies: Spring WEB, Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot DevTools, H2 Database, PostgreSQL Driver)  
- Frontend: Vite and React, TypeScript  
- Documentation: OpenAPI

### Overview
The primary goal of QuizMaster is to provide users with an engaging quiz experience. Key features include:

- Starting the game
- Receiving questions with answer choices
- Interacting with the game by answering questions
- Receiving a final score based on correct answers

I am proud to announce that all project goals have been achieved. In addition to the MVP, I've also implemented the following features:

- **Preventing Duplicate Questions:** No question will appear twice during a single game session.
- **User Database:** I've created a database to store user names and their scores, allowing to track and display leaderboards.
